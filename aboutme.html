    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In the future I am looking forward to pipe weld in the west. The reason I want to pipe weld is because I like to make things and put things together. When I am with my cousin, we always try to find broken down dirt bikes and four wheelers and make them better than before. I will work towards that goal by going to a welding school to learn how to weld pipe together and work in a shop for a little. When I learn a lot about welding then I will move to the middle of the state to do pipe welding. The most valuable lesson is that I need to be smart with the money I get and not blow all of it on things that I do not need. When I am collaborating with other people, I will help them out if they donâ€™t know what they are doing. A short-term goal that I have is to have my dream truck and have a big house. I would like to be known for having the best welds in the state. To achieve that I must work harder than the other people and practice the welding techniques.</p>
